# Dharat-tools

The word Dharat (ਧਰਤਿ) is a Gurmukhi (Punjabi) word, which means Earth/Land. 

This repository is for develpoing new tools to study Earth surface and its process. 
In its current release a new method is developed to estimate the depth of the landslide slip surface and its volume estimation using Spline interpolaton method. The method can be provided with additonal 1D borehole or 3D surface data to futher improve the results. 

In future, further improvements and new tools will be continuously added with widerange range of applicability to understand complex Earth Science challanges.
